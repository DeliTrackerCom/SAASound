Source Redistribution
---------------------

The following files are required to build SAASound support into WinCoupe, SAAEmu
or any other code that makes use of SAASound. Note that for a given application,
not all of the following files may be required.
SAASndC.h					
SAASound.h					
SAASound.lib				


If redistributing ANY of the files contained within this package, ALL files must be
redistributed, and may only be redistributed as an entire package. The only packages
that may be redistributed are those available at
http://www.geocities.com/stripwax/saa/saasource.zip

Any package which has been obtained from (and ONLY from) the above address may be
distributed freely. The following versions have been released previously to this release
and are therefore also freely redistributable:

SAASound package version 3.00.0:
		http://www.geocities.com/stripwax/saa/saasource_3_00_0.zip


If you believe you are in possession of an unofficial redistribution of the source code
and the corresponding SAASound.lib and SAASound.dll files, please visit the above
internet address or contact no-brain@mindless.com to obtain the latest official version.




Object Redistribution
---------------------

The only exception to the previous redistribution rule is that the SAASound.dll may be
redistributed PROVIDED it is also shipped with THIS licence statement, or the corresponding
licence statement included in whichever saasource.zip distribution the SAASound.dll in question
last appeared, (whichever is most recent), AND PROVIDED no other components of this SAASound
package are distributed alongside the dll and the licence statement.
This means that the following versions of SAASound.dll may be redistributed along with
the corresponding licence statements:

dll version			licence statement issue number
3.00.0				Issue 1
3.01.0				Issue 1 (3.01.0)


IT ALSO MEANS THAT VERSIONS OF SAASOUND.DLL PRIOR TO VERSION 3.00.0 MAY BE FREELY
DISTRIBUTED.

If you are currently redistributing SAASound.dll prior to version 3.00.0 it would
be greatly appreciated if you could update your distribution to include THIS licence
statement (issue 1). If this is not possible, a link to either  no-brain@mindless.com
or  http://www.geocities.com/stripwax/saa  MUST be provided in documentation that you
redistribute with the SAASound.dll


The latest DLL-only distribution (i.e. containing just SAASound.dll and LICENCE.TXT)
will always be available from
http://www.geocities.com/stripwax/saa/saasound.zip

MODIFIED SOURCE CODE AND/OR OBJECT CODE, MODIFIED DOCUMENTATION (INCLUDING THIS LICENCE)

NO PORTIONS OF THE EXISTING SOURCE CODE OR OBJECT CODE THAT MAKES UP SAASOUND MAY BE
DISTRIBUTED UNLESS THE ABOVE RULE AND THE RULES FOR OBJECT REDISTRIBUTION AND SOURCE
REDISTRIBUTION (ABOVE) ARE STRICTLY ADHERED TO, OR UNLESS I GIVE EXPLICIT CONSENT.

THE INTERFACES BETWEEN THE CODE MODULES THAT MAKE UP THE SAASOUND PACKAGE ARE ALSO COVERED
