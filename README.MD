SAA SOUND is a software emulation library for the Philips SAA-1099 sound chip device (popular in computing and gaming devices in the late 1980's / early 1990's).  Development of SAA SOUND began around 1996 with active development ceasing around 2001. 

Interest increased in August 2018 with the original author now revisiting the project after a considerable time.

It has been incorporated into standalone chiptune players, computer hardware emulators (e.g. SimCoupe), and has even been the basis of SAA-1099 hardware emulators implemented in FPGA devices (such as MiST / MiSTer)
